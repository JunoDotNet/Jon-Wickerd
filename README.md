# Jon-Wickerd Hi, I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a QA Engineer with a passion for visual clarity, usability, and reliable automation. Since graduating, Iâ€™ve been building test suites using Cypress and Postman, and applying real-world testing practices to personal projects. I focus on intuitive UI validation, design audits, and continuous improvement through automation.

ðŸ“Œ Pinned projects below showcase:
- UI testing with Cypress + GitHub Actions
- Postman API testing workflows
- Accessibility & usability QA documentation

Let's make things that *work* and *feel* right.
